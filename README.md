# Give a Chance by Chance 

## TL;DR
Our mission is to enable less fortunate individuals to build skills and references to develop a solid resume and get a chance back at life. 
Chance is a mobile-first platform that allows non-profits and local small businesses to post skill-based and community-involved jobs to help build skills and references. Chance is a web application made with the MERN stack and deployed on Heroku's servers.
